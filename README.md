## King County Housing Market Analysis Project

This project analyzes housing sales data across King County, Washington USA with the goal to uncover what truly drives home prices, from location and square footage to market conditions, home quality, and neighborhood characteristics.
Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) and Tableau, I explored the dataset end to end: cleaning, merging, structuring, modeling, and visualizing patterns that explain how and why prices shift across the region.

### King County Data Analysis & Insights

In this project, I explored King County’s home sales dataset to understand how property characteristics, city differences, and broader economic factors shape home values.

The analysis began with data cleaning, preparation and merging in Python, where I handled missing values, corrected inconsistent data types, removed outliers, engineered additional variables (e.g., price per sqft, monthly sales patterns, grade categories), merged geospatial json dataset, produced a structured and ready datasets ready for exploration.

**I then performed exploratory data analysis to examine:**
- How sales volumes change month by month
- How interest rate movements relate to buyer activity
- How home size, grade, and condition correlate with price
- How different cities compare in terms of affordability and premium pricing
- How segmentation patterns emerge through clustering

Next, I compiled a full set of Tableau dashboards that translate these analyses into intuitive visuals including trends, geospatial maps, cluster plots, and price comparisons, allowing stakeholders to quickly understand which neighborhoods are rising, where affordability is shifting, and what features consistently command higher valuations.

### This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Clean, prepare, and structure large datasets using Python.
- Clean and merge geospatial JSON datasets.
- Create meaningful analytical variables such as price per sqft, grade groups, and city level metrics.
- Perform exploratory analysis and uncover price drivers through correlations and clustering.
- Translate complex data into clear, visually intuitive dashboards using Tableau.
- Communicate insights effectively to both technical and non technical audiences
